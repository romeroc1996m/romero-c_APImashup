# The Studio Ghibli Movie API Mashup

## Project Overview

The Studio Ghibli Movie API Mashup is a web application designed to showcase the top five movies from Studio Ghibli. It combines a responsive and user-friendly interface with data fetched from an internal API and the external Ghibli API. The project leverages modern web technologies to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience, allowing fans to explore detailed information about their favorite Studio Ghibli movies.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Movie Display**: Utilizes Vue.js to dynamically render movie information on the frontend, including titles, banners, and descriptions, fetched from the backend API.
- **Interactive Movie Details**: Offers an interactive feature where users can click on a movie to view detailed information, such as the director, producer, release date, running time, and rating score, fetched from the external Ghibli API.
- **Responsive Design**: Implements a responsive layout using HTML5 and SASS, ensuring the website is accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Backend API**: Features a custom-built API using Lumen PHP, which handles CRUD operations for managing movie data stored in a database.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporates error handling both in the frontend and backend, enhancing the reliability and user experience of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS (SASS)**: Utilized for structuring and styling the frontend of the Studio Ghibli Movie API Mashup website. HTML5 provides the semantic structure, while SASS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS, enhances CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins for more efficient styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Employed for creating dynamic content and implementing interactive features on the website. The codebase leverages modern JavaScript syntax and features (ES6+), such as template literals, arrow functions, and promises for asynchronous operations, to enhance the site's functionality and user experience.
- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. The frontend leverages Vue.js to create a reactive and engaging experience by binding data to the DOM and managing the application's state with minimal overhead. Vue's component-based architecture facilitates the development of scalable and maintainable code.
- **Lumen (PHP)**: A lightweight micro-framework by Laravel, used for building the backend API of the Studio Ghibli Movie Mashup. Lumen is designed for building microservices and APIs, providing a fast and elegant way to handle requests and responses, interact with databases, and perform other server-side tasks.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in the source code during development. Git supports collaboration among developers and is instrumental in managing the project's codebase, allowing for features like branching, merging, and versioning to facilitate efficient and parallel development workflows.
